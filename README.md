# RAG Chatbot using LangChain and ChromaDB

This repository contains a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) chatbot built using LangChain and ChromaDB. The application is implemented in the `app.py` file and is deployed as a web application using Streamlit.

## Project Overview

This project was developed as a hackathon submission to address a real-world problem faced by the Department of Technical Education, Government of Rajasthan. During the admission process, numerous engineering and polytechnic institutes receive a high volume of inquiries from students, parents, and other stakeholders. These queries range from admissions and fee structures to scholarships and placement opportunities.

The traditional methods of handling these inquiriesâ€”through phone, email, or in-person visits demand significant manpower. This project aims to streamline the process by creating an AI-powered chatbot that serves as a virtual assistant, available 24/7 to provide instant responses to a wide range of questions. This solution not only enhances accessibility to important information but also reduces the workload on college staff.
### Key Features

1. Efficient Information Retrieval: The chatbot rapidly accesses and provides accurate information on topics such as admissions, fees, and scholarships using advanced NLP.
2. Enhanced User Experience: The chatbot interface is intuitive and capable of understanding natural language, making it user-friendly.
3. Reduced Workload: By automating responses to frequently asked questions, the chatbot reduces the need for human intervention, allowing staff to focus on more complex queries.
4. Data Insights: The chatbot gathers valuable data from user interactions, helping the department optimize its services.
## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.6 or later
- Streamlit
- LangChain
- ChromaDB

All required Python packages are listed in the `requirements.txt` file.

### Installation and Running the App

1. **Clone the repository (if applicable):**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Kunal-sharan/SSH_24_Techtronix.git
   cd SSH_24_Techtronix
   ```

2. **Install the required packages:**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run the Streamlit application:**

   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

This will start the Streamlit server, and you can interact with the RAG Chatbot by navigating to `http://localhost:8501` in your web browser.

### How the RAG Chatbot Works

- **LangChain:** This is used to manage the logic of the chatbot, combining language models with external data sources.
- **ChromaDB:** This is a vector database that stores and retrieves relevant documents or information to augment the language model's responses.
- **GROQ/Llama:** This is the actual llm used which utilises the query response from the vector database and returned embeddings to give a smooth and effective response.

The chatbot leverages these tools to retrieve information from ChromaDB and use it to generate accurate and contextually relevant responses.

### Application Structure

- **app.py:** The main script containing the Streamlit app and chatbot logic.
- **requirements.txt:** Lists the Python dependencies required to run the application.

### Deployment

To deploy the app on a hosting platform such as Streamlit Cloud, follow their documentation and ensure your repository contains both the `app.py` and `requirements.txt` files.
