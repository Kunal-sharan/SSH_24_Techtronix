This is where B.Tech in Computer Science is so crucial. It introduces students to a vast pool of technological knowledge, shape their coding abilities, development their intuitive thinking, and even help them to work on the hardware. Of several computer science departments, data science and artificial intelligence are the two most popular specializations students can opt for a bright career. Since these courses are new to the students, read the following article to learn more about the course programs, subjects to be covered, and so on. ### Scope of Data Science Data science is one of the most popular technologies with a golden future that will help businesses deal in real\-time. Data is often considered an asset for companies because it holds more information than one can comprehend. If the extraction is done successfully, it will become possible for the data analysts to find the trends and patterns in the same and prepare analytical reports. As a data science engineer, you will be responsible for dealing with datasets collected from various sources the business deals with. Based on the obtained information, it will become easier to make decisions based on real\-time data. Apart from this, the datasets will help compare the past and the present to predict the future through forecasting. It can be the endpoints of sales channels, social media accounts, sales and revenues, etc. Another major important role that a data science engineer needs to handle is that of miners. Data miners are professionals who gather unstructured data from the sources and arrange all the information in a properly structured pattern so that analysts can easily work on the datasets without any errors. ### Scope of Artificial Intelligence Just like data science, artificial intelligence will also have a crucial role in shaping the future world, especially since the market is gradually transforming itself into a digital platform. From the name itself, you can understand that AI involves a set of protocols and IT practices to harness human intelligence and deduce a set of inputs. This way, the outputs generated are mostly accurate and almost match the desired value. The exceptional accuracy level and the ability of software or machine to think like a human make artificial intelligence so popular. As an AI scientist or engineer, you can go for software development. You have to develop different applications and websites based on artificial intelligence. For example, Google’s voice or Alexa are based on AI technology, software integrated into a machine like speakers and mobile phones. Another major area where you can work as an artificial engineer is robotics. Robots are used in factories, homes, warehouses, and several other places to fasten the work and reduce dependency on human labour. Besides, these robots are integrated with automated functioning systems to perform the scheduled operations with no interference to take the robotics industry to the next level. Artificial engineers will play a crucial role. They can help integrate human intelligence into the robot’s mind, allowing them to think independently and act accordingly. South Korea has already started using AI robots at their airports to guide tourists in and out of the airport like a virtual guides. ### Program Objectives: * After completing artificial intelligence with CSE, the students will be able to handle physical and software robots. * Data scientists will know how to extract data from different locations and arrange them in a structured pattern. * Data scientists can use R programming to design graphs of different types based on tabulated data forms. * Artificial intelligence can even automate any manual working system concerning software and machines. * It will become possible for data engineers to draw reports and forecasts for any business aspect. * Thanks to data scientists, it becomes easier for the stakeholders to decide because all the datasets and analytical reports are in real\-time. * Artificial intelligence professionals can also work with testing teams to develop programs and automate the functions. ### Career Opportunities in Artificial Intelligence and Data Science Being the topmost technologies, both data science and artificial intelligence will provide students with some of the best career opportunities. Not only can they grab jobs with higher salaries or at the top\-rated recruiters, but they can also work in unique job roles like system engineer, IT analyst, and other such roles are very common. When someone starts a career in the IT industry as a data science engineer, the minimum salary is not less than INR 7 lakhs. Therefore, one can opt for better career opportunities with either of these two specializations or both. ### Career Prospects in Data Science \& Artificial Intelligence * Data science engineer * Data analyst * Data miner * Data science senior analyst * Data engineer * IT security analyst * Artificial intelligence engineer * System engineer * Robotics engineer * Performance tester * RPA tester ### Salient Features of the Department [### Industry Ready Curriculum GIT introduces an industry\-level curriculum for the students opted for B.Tech in computer science.](#) [### Project Based Learnings GIT has implemented different curriculum protocols to train their students concerning real\-life projects in the IT industry](#) [### Well\-Equipped Laboratories GIT has revamped its labs and introduced new, modern equipment to ensure students have better leverage in learning about the practical implementation.](#) [### Certified and Qualified Faculty Team the faculty team at GIT is highly experienced and has in\-depth knowledge about the particular domain](#) [### Opportunities for Co\-Curricular and Extra\-Curricular Activities GIT college organizes sports, cultural, and technical fest every year to ensure all students feel safe and relaxed.

Privatization, widespread expansion, increased autonomy and introduction of Programmes in new and emerging areas have improved access to higher education. At the same time, it has also led to widespread concern on the quality and relevance of the higher education. To address these concerns, the National Policy on Education (NPE, 1986\) and the Programme of Action (PoA, 1992\) spelt out strategic plans for the policies, advocated the establishment of an independent National accreditation agency. Consequently, the National Assessment and Accreditation Council (NAAC) was established in 1994 as an autonomous institution of the University Grants Commission (UGC) with its Head Quarter in Bengaluru. The mandate of NAAC as reflected in its vision statement is in making quality assurance an integral part of the functioning of Higher Education Institutions (HEIs). The NAAC functions through its General Council (GC) and Executive Committee (EC) comprising educational administrators, policy makers and senior academicians from a cross\-section of Indian higher education system. The Chairperson of the UGC is the President of the GC of the NAAC, the Chairperson of the EC is an eminent academician nominated by the President of GC (NAAC). The Director is the academic and administrative head of NAAC and is the member\-secretary of both the GC and the EC. In addition to the statutory bodies that steer its policies and core staff to support its activities NAAC is advised by the advisory and consultative committees constituted from time to time.

Since quality enhancement is a continuous process, the IQAC becomes a part of the institution’s system and works towards realization of the goals of quality enhancement and sustenance. The prime task of the IQAC is to develop a system for conscious, consistent and catalytic improvement in the overall performance of institutions.
