The tangible assets like inventions, designs, software, brand name and other creative \& innovative ideas are more valuable than physical assets. PIET IPR Cell is committed to encourage, protect, manage and commercialize Intellectual Property such as Patent, Copyright, Trademark etc. generated through the College. The cell creates conducive environment in the academics for the development of Intellectual Property. Faculty and students of PIET are actively participating in the IPR filing process in different disciplines of Engineering \& Technology. # Importance of IPR It is necessary to protect the Intellectual property in order to enable organizations to earn recognition or financial benefits. Governments of various countries protect the innovative ideas of the inventors through Intellectual Property Rights (IPR). Recently, IPR has become a central issue in the developed and developing countries. The rationale for this IPR lies in the need to create awareness about the importance of IPRs as a marketable financial asset and economic tool among the researchers, faculty and students of the College. Intellectual property Rights: means the rights derived from the IP e.g. Patents, registered designs, copyright etc. # Objectives * To create an awareness about IPR for faculties and students of the Institution. * To impart training on future endeavours regarding patent filing processes, procedure of IPR, screen projects, make drafts and file patents to the competing authority. * To conduct workshops, seminars and training course on IPR. * To promote better understanding of IPR. * To encourage faculty members and students to go patentable works. * Frame and keep updated IPR Policy of the Institution. * Communicate the IPR Policy to the various stakeholders and the Inventors of the Institution, students in general. * Identify prospective inventions, innovations, Service improvement ideas and Copy rights. * Study and recommend inventions etc for feasibility of converting to patents/Copy Rights. * To promote technology advancements for improved quality of life and environment protection. # Strategies IPR cell shall guide and help the faculty members and students of PIET in patentability assessment and to apply for various IPRs such as Invention(s), Designs, Integrated Circuit Layouts and other creative works. The faculty members /students desirous of filing a patent or for any other IPR application would be given the necessary advice and guidance by the IPR cell. An internal approval from the Principal wherein the names of the Inventors/Authors shall be mentioned is to be signed by the Principal and forwarded by the HOD for approval of the Head of IPR Cell. Invention Patent /Trademark and similar documents are to be treated and maintained confidentially by the IPR Cell. The IPR cell shall help the inventor in drafting the patent application/ or any other IPR application and filling of relevant forms. The draft application along with the relevant forms shall be forwarded to the concerned authority by the IPR cell. Any work sought to be filed by a faculty member and or student(s) arising out of R\&D work done at PIET will be filed in joint names as inventors or authors while PIET shall be the applicant and owner of Intellectual Property (IP). After filing of the application for IP protection, the inventors shall inform the IPR cell of any further development, if any, in the related R \& D work. # Types of IP: * **Patent:** is an exclusive right granted for an invention, which is a product or a process that provides a new way of doing something, or offers a new technical solution to a problem. * **Copyright:** is an exclusive right given to the author of the original literary, architectural, dramatic, musical and artistic works; cinematograph films; and sound recordings. * **Trade/Service mark:** means a mark capable of being represented graphically and which is capable of distinguishing the goods or services of one person from those of others and may include shape of goods, their packaging and combination of colours. * **Industrial Design:** means only the features of shape, configuration, pattern, ornament or composition of lines or colours applied to any article whether in two dimensional or three dimensional or in both forms, by any industrial process or means, whether manual, mechanical or chemical, separate or combined, which in the finished article appeal to and are judged solely by the eye; but does not include any mode or principle of construction or anything which is in substance a mere mechanical device. * **IC Layout Designs:** means a layout of transistors and other circuitry elements and includes lead wires connecting such elements and expressed in any manner in a semiconductor integrated circuit. * **New Plant Variety:** a plant variety that is novel, distinct and shows uniform and stable characteristics. * **Biotechnology Inventions:** include recombinant products such as vectors, nucleotide sequences and micro‐organisms. * **Traditional Knowledge:** The knowledge developed by the indigenous or local communities for the use of a natural resource with respect to agriculture, food, medicine etc. over a period of time and has been passed from one generation to another traditionally. * **Geographical Indications:** means an indication which identify such goods as agricultural goods, natural goods as originating or manufactured in the territory of a country or manufactured in the territory of a country or a region or locality in that territory where a given quality, reputation or other characteristic of such goods is essentially attributable to its geographical origin and in case where such goods are manufactured one of the activities of either the production or of processing or preparation of the goods concerned takes place in such territory, regions or locality as the case may be. ## **IPR Committee** | S.No | Name | Designation | Institute Name/Company name | Contact No. | Email Address | | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | | 1 | Dr. Dinesh Goyal | Director | Poornima Institute of Engineering \& Technology, Jaipur | 9887678379 | dinesh.goyal@poornima.org | | 2 | Mr. Pankaj kumar | IPR Trainer and Facilitator | I P constellation (IPC) Private Limited | 8619109061 | ipr.pkumar@gmail.com | | 3 | Dr. Payal Bansal | HOD, IOT | Poornima Institute of Engineering \& Technology, Jaipur | 97854 87195 | payal.bansal@poornima.org | | 4 | Mr Ashish Jain | Managing Director | Anktech Software Pvt.

The goal is to introduce a "learner\-centric" approach and provide greater flexibility in the education system. This will enable students to choose multi\-disciplinary, intra\-disciplinary and skill\-based courses based on their interests. # NEP 2020: A thrust on Indian Knowledge System The Indian Knowledge System (IKS) has been a topic of discussion in Indian education. For centuries, the Western perception has been the dominant influence in our education, ignoring or rejecting Indian\-origin knowledge. IKS aims to balance knowledge and skills to create graduates who can produce new knowledge, use it wisely, and apply it effectively. The traditional Indian Knowledge Tradition focuses on 'how' to know rather than 'what' to know. Today, new technologies pose a challenge to human existence. # WHAT IS IKS? Indian Knowledge System (IKS) is a vast repository of knowledge available in Sanskrit, Pali, Prakrit, and all native Indian languages. It encompasses Foundational knowledge, Science, Engineering \& Technology, Humanities, and Social Sciences through a structured classification. IKS has a wide range of branches like Astronomy, Ayurveda \& Yoga, Mathematics, and Computing, Languages and Linguistics, and many more. Eighteen Vidya Sthanas were part of ancient Indian education. Today, this knowledge base is much needed for knowledge diplomacy. India has a treasure of knowledge that enriched the Indian civilization for millennia. # NEP implication in PIET PIET is affiliated to Rajasthan Technical University, Kota and offers various engineering programs in Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence, Data Science, Artificial Intelligence \& Data Science and IOT. The institute promotes interdisciplinary interaction among students and faculty and aligns its vision with NEP for the holistic development of the learners. PIET is also the first institute to offer the B.Tech in Regional Language., The institute teaches various subjects including disaster management, communication skills, technical communication, universal human values, and managerial economics. The institute offers regular activities like blood donation camps, human values projects, and various courses through NPTEL\-Swayam MOOCs and Coursera. Clubs like PBIC, Aptinues Club, and Literary Club are also available. The NEP implementation roadmap is also in progress. At PIET, innovative teaching methods are used for IKS, avoiding bookish teaching and using audiovisual materials, field studies, and primary sources. A database of authentic resources is created, and faculty contributes to it with peer review. A list of IKS content in regional languages is compiled. Field visits to prominent IKS\-related places are organized. Life and work of original thinkers who used IKS framework are shared. Faculty is encouraged to conduct original research and take courses related to IKS. Student Council has organized competitions in various subjects, including natural sciences, social sciences, humanities, engineering, medicine, agriculture, community knowledge systems, fine and performing arts, and vocational skills with IKS content. The courses must map traditional IKS subjects with modern subjects such as math and language. Faculty are introduced to IKS vocabulary during the Orientation Program. Expert talks on Time Management and Mental Health and immersive sessions on Yoga and Meditation are conducted. Annual events like AROHAN and Blood donation Camp, awareness drives, road shows, and interactions are conducted to promote culture and heritage.

The most important components are the Course Outcome (CO's) Program Outcomes (POs), Program Specific Outcome (PSO's). A knowledge\-based society characterized by a scientific outlook and a culture of cooperation is the long\-term goal of the Poornima Institute of Engineering \& Technology, Jaipur. The institute's mission is to educate students for success in an increasingly globalized economy by providing them with a balanced education. Course Outcomes (COs) are defined for each course using Bloom's Taxonomy by each course coordinator and are approved Department Advisory Board. The Program Outcomes are in line with Washington Accord \& NBA guidelines, catering to Graduate Attributed. All the CO’s and mapped with Program Outcomes (POs) and Program Specific Outcomes (PSOs) for further attainment analysis. The attainment of CO’s, PSO \& PO’s in a academic year become benchmarks for Next academic session, for bridging the gap in Quality teaching pedagogy, Faculty Quality, Ambience of Institutions, Innovative practices in Teaching methodology including ICT techniques, enrichment of co\-curricular \& beyond curricular activities and improvement in curriculum. All of the undergraduate degree programs at the institution use this instructional strategy. # OBE Framework * Identify \& define the learning outcomes at all levels and explicitly document the same in the curriculum. * Organizing the teaching and learning activity through student – centered activity and project base learning. * Assessment and evaluation at all levels of learning outcomes i.e. PSOs , POs and COs ![logo](images/obe/flow1.png) # Formulation PO’s and PSO’s: Program Outcomes (POs): » Program outcomes are statements that describe what students are expected to know and be able to do upon graduating from the program. » These are associated with the information, attitude, and conduct that students take away from the four\-year curriculum, as well as their analytical abilities, knowledge, and skills. The POs basically show what the students can accomplish with the information they get from the curriculum. Therefore, POs characterize the characteristics of an engineering graduate's professional life. The following twelve points of view (POs) are relevant to all engineering curricula and were developed by the NBA for engineering graduates. Program Specific Outcomes (PSOs): » Program Specific Outcomes means what the graduate students of a specific degree program should be able to do and Course Outcomes are the resultant knowledge skills that the students acquire at the end of the course. PSOs are built on three behavioral components: knowledge, skill, and attitude. PSOs are statements made by the institute to stakeholders (employers, students, etc.) that should be measurable, appropriate, realistic, and achievable. They describe the career and professional accomplishments that the program is preparing graduates to accomplish after 4 years of graduation. ![logo](images/obe/flow2.png) ### **Objective of Outcome Based Education Reflection** # Program Outcomes The National Board of Accreditation (NBA) defines program outcomes as statements that specify what students are expected to know and be able to do by the time of their graduation. These are in line with the Graduate Attributes as defined by the Washington Accord. These outcomes articulate the skills, knowledge, and attitudes that students should possess upon completing their educational program. Program outcomes serve as benchmarks for assessing the effectiveness of the curriculum and ensuring that it aligns with the objectives of the program. They provide a framework for evaluating student performance and guiding continuous improvement efforts within the educational institution. * **Engineering Knowledge:** Apply the knowledge of mathematics, science, engineering fundamentals, and an engineering specialization to the solution of complex engineering problems. * **Problem Analysis:** Identify, formulate, review research literature, and analyze complex engineering problems reaching substantiated conclusions using first principles of mathematics, natural sciences, and engineering sciences. * **Design/Development of Solutions:** Design solutions for complex engineering problems and design system components or processes that meet the specified needs with appropriate consideration for the public health and safety, and the cultural, societal, and environmental considerations. * **Conduct Investigations of Complex Problems:** Use research\-based knowledge and research methods including design of experiments, analysis and interpretation of data, and synthesis of the information to provide valid conclusions. * **Modern Tool Usage:**Create, select, and apply appropriate techniques, resources, and modern engineering and IT tools including prediction and modeling to complex engineering activities with an understanding of the limitations. * **The Engineer and Society:** Apply reasoning informed by the contextual knowledge to assess societal, health, safety, legal and cultural issues and the consequent responsibilities relevant to the professional engineering practice. * **Environment and Sustainability:** Understand the impact of the professional engineering solutions in societal and environmental contexts, and demonstrate the knowledge of, and need for sustainable development. * **Ethics:**Apply ethical principles and commit to professional ethics and responsibilities and norms of the engineering practice. * **Individual and Team Work:** Function effectively as an individual, and as a member or leader in diverse teams, and in multidisciplinary settings. * **Communication:** Communicate effectively on complex engineering activities with the engineering community and with society at large, such as, being able to comprehend and write effective reports and design documentation, make effective presentations, and give and receive clear instructions. * **Project Management and Finance:** Demonstrate knowledge and understanding of the engineering and management principles and apply these to one’s own work, as a member and leader in a team, to manage projects and in multidisciplinary environments. * **Life\-Long Learning:** Recognize the need for, and have the preparation and ability to engage in independent and life\-long learning in the broadest context of technological change. # The Process of Refinement of PO’s The refinement of Program Outcomes (POs) involves iterative assessment, stakeholder engagement, and curriculum alignment. Initially defined based on accreditation guidelines, POs are continuously reviewed with input from faculty, industry experts, and students. Curriculum alignment ensures that educational objectives match desired outcomes. Assessment methods are refined to measure PO attainment effectively. Feedback from stakeholders informs adjustments, fostering alignment with industry needs and educational standards. This iterative process ensures POs remain relevant and reflective of program goals, facilitating continuous improvement in educational quality. ![logo](images/obe/flow6.png) # Process for Defining PSOs The program Assessment committee along with the stake holders define the program specific outcomes after having a brain storming session with the stake holders. ![logo](images/obe/flow3.png) ### **Process of Defining PSO’s of the Department** # Process Involved in CO\-PO Mapping The role of CO\-PO mapping will be assigned to the faculty as per hierarchy. After the course (subject) allotment from the department, the course in\-charge of the course has to write appropriate COs for their corresponding course. It should be narrower and measurable statements. By using the action verbs of learning levels, CO’s will be designed. CO statements should describe what the students are expected to know and able to do at the end of each course, which are related to the skills, knowledge and behavior that students will acquire through the course. ![logo](images/obe/flow8.png) # OBE Booklets | S.

The only request that we have is to plan the activities that should not affect the regular academics of students. The respective department ISTE Faculty members are required to conduct the activities in their department which consists of preparing the invitation for the program, planning for refreshments(if required), formally inviting the HODs, faculty and staff through e\-mail, photography etc. After the event, the department office bearer needs to send one page report about the event to the ISTE Institute Coordinator with a copy to HOD of their respective department as well as to ISTE Secretary to keep them updated. Along with the report, selected 3\-4 photos of the event also need to be sent. The ISTE banner which is available with the stores needs to be taken by the respective department member and after using the banner; they need to replace it back to the stores without any damage. # FINANCIAL SUPPORT FOR THE ENTIRE ACTIVITIES IN PIET To conduct the activities in the institute, we need not have to take any permission from ISTE New Delhi, it is all the decision with the institute level only. Only if there is any FDP proposal which is sponsored by ISTE, then we need to follow the procedures as per the proposal. Otherwise, the financial support from PIET in conducting several activities in the institute can be managed with the ISTE account of PIET itself, which includes remuneration for guest speakers, travel allowance, memento, refreshments, certificates, gifts, etc. # FACULTY COORDINATORS FOR ISTE STUDENT CHAPTER | S.No | Name | | | --- | --- | --- | | 01 | ISTE Sponsored Activities in last six years | | ## About * [Mandatory Disclosure](http://www.piet.poornima.org/PIET_NAAC_SSR/mandatory-disclosure.pdf) * [Grievance Submission](gievancesubmission.html) * [Campus Life @ PIET](http://www.piet.poornima.org/PIET_NAAC_SSR/videos/College_life.mp4) * [Green Campus](http://www.piet.poornima.org/PIET_NAAC_SSR/videos/Green_Campus.mp4) ## SOCIAL LINKS © 2024\.
