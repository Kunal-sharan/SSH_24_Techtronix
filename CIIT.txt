Curriculum Implementation Teaching Scheme indicating periods per week for
theory, practical and tutorials are laid down by RTU along with detailed
syllabus and books. This curriculum laid down by RTU is implemented by the
college by making session plans for each subject, lesson and teaching plans
for each topic covering the whole syllabus of each subject as laid down by
RTU. We, in the college, have system of weekly Time Table, wherein a student
knows as to what topic is to be covered on a particular date. In addition, we
have a student volunteer in every class, who gives the feedback to the Dean
(Academics), about the quality of teaching on Daily Monitoring Report (DMR),
everyday. Two mid terms exams in theory and two internal practical exams are
conducted in every Semester to monitor progressive teaching and learning
process of the whole syllabus. These exams account for 20% of the marks in
theory and 60% of the mark in practical out of total marks allocated by RTU in
each subject. The result of mid-term exams is conveyed to students, to enable
them to understand as to where they should put more hardwork. When time
permits we give test series to the students before University Exams, like pre-
board exams. The whole Academic Implementation System is available on the
College Management Information System (MIS), where in every teacher updates
the progress in teaching their respective subject along with attendance of
students, being uploaded every Saturday, which can be seen by students and
parents by using the students ID and password. The students can also enter
their feedback about teaching quality in theory and practicals in MIS which is
a unique facility provided to students, of this college. Wi-Fi is provided in
the college and hostels to enable the students to use laptops/computers in the
campus, effectively. Compucom Software Limited, a sister organization, which
has proven track record of software development and export, and has been
awarded by State and Central Governments, is available to our students, for on
the Job Training, Live Projects and Industrial Training. CIITM Virtual Tour
